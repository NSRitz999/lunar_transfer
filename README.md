# Lunar Transfer

This app seeks to solve a simple problem: data transfer from mobile devices (primarily from iOS) to computers. Similar to how airdrop can share files between all apple products, this app is designed to create a simple approach for sharing files across non-apple devices through the SMB protocol (network file sharing).

## Technical Details

This app was developed using the Flutter Stacked production architecture framework, which enables easy adherence to the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture. Additionally, this app uses my own APIs for fast development of new apps in Flutter. Since these APIs are private, you will not be able to run these apps on personal machines.
