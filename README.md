# Flutter Toolkit - Template App

This is a simple base repository for including all of the APIs I personally developed for Flutter (aka, all of the ones prefaced by 'Flutter Toolkit' or 'fkt\_...'). This app is meant to help speed up the develpoment process by having a base custom configuration that I can use for all future apps.

# Usage

To get started, remember to run the following command before anything else:

```
rm -rf .git

# or (depending on OS)

sudo rm -r .git
```

This is to remove the `ftk_template_app` repository information and enable you, the developer, to easily add a remote repository for this app. See? Simple Setup XD.
